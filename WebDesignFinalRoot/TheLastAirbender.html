                <h2>Series Synopsis</h2>
                  <p>One hundred years before the start of the series, a twelve  year old airbender named Aang learns that he is the new Avatar. Fearful of the  heavy responsibilities of stopping an impending world war and with the  impending separation from his mentor, Monk Gyatso, Aang flees from home on his  flying bison, Appa. During a fierce storm, they crash into the ocean, and  Aang's Avatar State freezes them in a state of suspended animation inside an  iceberg.</p>

                  <p><img src="images/AangWater.jpg" alt="" width="244" height="348" class="FloatLeft"/>Aang and Appa are awoken a hundred years later by two  siblings of Southern Water Tribe origin, Katara and Sokka. Aang learns that the  Fire Nation started a war a hundred years earlier, just after his  disappearance. The Fire Nation's opening move in its campaign for global conquest  was to launch a genocidal attack on the Air Nomads which drove Aang's entire  race to extinction, thus making him &quot;the last airbender&quot; left alive.  He realizes that he must fulfill his destiny of becoming a fully realized  Avatar and return balance to the world by defeating the Fire Nation. Aang sets  out to master the three unlearned elements: water, earth, and fire. With Katara  and Sokka, Aang decides to head first to the North Pole to find a waterbending  master.<br />
                Aang soon discovers that Sozin's Comet, which Fire Lord  Sozin used as a power supply to start the Hundred Year War, will return in the  coming summer, giving the Fire Nation enough power to ultimately accomplish  victory. Aang realizes that he must master all four elements and end the War  before this time. For most of their journey to the North Pole, the group is  pursued by Zuko, a banished Fire Nation prince and son of Fire Lord Ozai who is  obsessed with capturing Aang to restore his lost honor. </p></td>

                  <p> <img src="images/AangEarth.jpg" alt="" width="250" height="349" class="FloatLeft" />After leaving the North Pole and mastering waterbending,  Aang travels to the Earth Kingdom to master earthbending. There, the group  meets Toph, a blind earthbending prodigy who becomes Aang's second teacher. The  heroes discover information about an upcoming solar eclipse which would leave  the Fire Nation powerless and open to invasion. They struggle to reach the  Earth King with this vital information, but are detoured by Appa's kidnapping.  The psychologically self-tormented Zuko, his sister Azula, and her two friends  Mai and Ty Lee chase the group as they struggle to reach Ba Sing Se. Azula  engineers a coup from within that topples the Earth King and destroys any hope  of a large-scale invasion of the Fire Nation.</p>

On the day of the solar eclipse, Aang's group and  a smaller band of warriors launch a smaller invasion, which ultimately fails.  Zuko confronts his father and defects from the Fire Nation. After a series of  events, he manages to gain the trust of the protagonists and becomes Aang's  firebending teacher. Aang and Zuko unlock the true secrets of firebending from  the ancient &quot;Sun Warriors&quot;, Sokka and Zuko later travel to a Fire  Nation prison called the Boiling Rock to rescue Sokka's father and Suki, a  warrior from Kyoshi Island.
                On the day of Sozin's Comet, Fire Lord Ozai harnesses the  comet's incredible power and energy to start a genocidal campaign to destroy  the rest of the world. Aang and his friends split up to face the  self-proclaimed Phoenix King Ozai, Azula (about to be crowned as the new Fire  Lord), and the Fire Nation air fleet accompanying Ozai. Aang confronts and  defeats Ozai. Zuko and Katara defeat Azula before her coronation. Sokka, Toph,  and Suki destroy the air fleet. Zuko becomes the new Fire Lord and promises to  help the world rebuild from one hundred years of war and suffering.</p></td>
