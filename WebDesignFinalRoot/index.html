			      <p>Avatar: The Last Airbender, also known as Avatar: The Legend  of Aang in PAL regions, is an Emmy award-winning American animated television  series that aired for three seasons on Nickelodeon and the Nicktoons Network.  The series was created and produced by Michael Dante DiMartino and Bryan  Konietzko, who served as executive producers along with Aaron Ehasz. Avatar's  setting is in an Asian-influenced world of martial arts and elemental  manipulation. The show drew on elements from East Asian, South Asian, and  Western culture, making it a mixture of what were previously traditionally  separate categories of Japanese anime and Western domestic cartoons.</p>
			      <p>
			        The series follows the adventures of the main protagonist  Aang and his friends, who must save the world by defeating Fire Lord Ozai and  ending the destructive war with the Fire Nation. The show first aired on  February 21, 2005 and the series concluded with a widely-lauded two-hour  television movie on July 19, 2008. The show is now available on DVD, the iTunes  Store, the Xbox Live Marketplace, the PlayStation Network, and the Zune  Marketplace, along with one of Nickelodeon's spinoff networks, Nicktoons.</p>
			      <p>
			        Avatar: The Last Airbender was popular with both audiences  and critics, garnering 5.6 million viewers on its best-rated showing and  receiving high ratings in the Nicktoons lineup, even outside its 6â€“11-year-old  demographic. Avatar has been nominated for and won awards from the Annual Annie  Awards, the Genesis Awards and the primetime Emmy Awards, among others. The  first season's success prompted Nickelodeon to order second and third seasons.  The first part of a movie trilogy titled The Last Airbender was released on July  1, 2010.</p>
                <p>Merchandise based on the series includes scaled action  figures, a trading card game, three video games based individually on each  season, stuffed animals distributed by Paramount Parks, and two LEGO sets. The  series' popularity spawned a sequel series, titled The Legend of Korra, which  takes place seventy years after the original series.</p></td>
