                  <p> Although the one-hundred-year War is finally over, tensions  run high as thirteen-year-old A<img src="images/ThePromise.jpg" alt="" width="230" height="344" class="FloatLeft"/>vatar Aang and seventeen-year-old Zuko are put  on a &quot;collision course&quot; after the Avatar travels to a Fire Nation  colony named &quot;Yu Dao&quot;, and finds &quot;tension between  neighbors&quot; â€“ a threat that may &quot;shatter the world's newfound  peace&quot;.</p>
                  <p> The unfinished conversation between Zuko and Ozai about the  whereabouts of Ursa, Zuko's long-lost mother, is completed, but the  conversation takes a different path after Zuko asks the question and her fate  still remains unknown. Zuko forces Aang to promise to kill him if he becomes  like his father, the deposed Fire Lord Ozai.Negotiations with Earth King Kuei and the beginning of the  Harmony Restoration Movement commence. The movement plans to take the people in  the Fire Nation colonies and move them into the Fire Nation itself. However, an  unexpected controversy breaks out, as the older colonies are composed of people  who have never lived within the Fire Nation and have intermarried with Earth  Kingdom citizens. These people view the movement as robbing them of their  homes. Fire Lord Zuko is caught between the desires of his people and the  demands of many who believe peace and balance is only attainable if fire nation  citizens return to their country. When the Earth Kingdom army arrives to  enforce the Restoration Movement, Zuko deploys his own forces in defense of the  colonies, leading to an explosive showdown between the recently belligerent  sides and threatening to reignite the fires of war. Aang must decide whether to  follow through on his promise, and decide the fate of the colonies in the  process.</p>
                  <p> In the midst of this dispute, Toph's new metal bending  school finds itself in trouble, while Aang is confronted with the &quot;Avatar  Fan Movement,&quot; a growing group of young individuals trying to live as the  air nomads did, but Aang views these people as parodying and denigrating the  memory of his people. </p>

Their conflict with the group is complicated by  the fact that it is led by Mai's own estranged father, and appears to be in  league with a group of malevolent spirits known as the Kemurikage.</p>
