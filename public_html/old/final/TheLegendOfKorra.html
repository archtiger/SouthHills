			      <p>
		          <img src="images/KorraAir.png" width="250" height="351" class="FloatLeft"/>After the conclusion of the Hundred Year War, Avatar Aang  and Fire Lord Zuko had brought people from the four nations together and  founded the United Republic of Nations, with its capital being Republic City, a  large &quot;metropolis powered by steampunk-type technology&quot; such as cars  and motorcycles. Aang and Katara had three children, the youngest of which was  Tenzin, the only airbender of the three siblings. Meanwhile, Toph Beifong had  traveled extensively to teach metalbending to other earthbenders. After Aang's  death in 153 AG, he was reincarnated as a Southern Water Tribe girl named  Korra.</p>
			      <p>
			        At the present time, seventy years after the end of the  Hundred Year War, Korra, a rebellious, seventeen-year-old girl, is set to  complete her airbending training and fulfill her role as the Avatar. She has  already mastered waterbending, earthbending, and firebending by this point. At  the beginning of the series, Korra travels to Republic City and starts her  airbending training with Tenzin. Tenzin himself is married to Pema. He has two  daughters, Jinora, a &quot;bookworm&quot;, and Ikki, a &quot;motor-mouth&quot;,  while Meelo, his first son, was his only son until the tenth episode,  &quot;Turning the Tides&quot;, when Pema gave birth to another boy named Rohan.</p>
			      <p>
			        However, Republic City is not what Korra imagined it to be.  Anti-benders called &quot;Equalists&quot;, who oppose the arts of bending,  utilize techniques such as chi blocking to further their goals of revolution,  led by Amon. Korra must fight rampant crime and the Anti-bending Revolution,  assisted by two brothers, Mako, a firebender, and Bolin, an earthbender. She is  also joined by her animal companion, Naga, and the Metalbending Police Force of  Republic City, who are led by Toph's daughter, Lin Beifong.                  </p>

                <p> <img src="images/KorraBalance.jpg" alt="" width="225" height="318" class="FloatLeft"/>Following the insurrection of the Red Lotus, Korra left to  the Southern Water Tribe to recuperate and Team Avatar moved on with their  lives. Three years later, in 174 AG, the former captain of Zaofu's guard,  Kuvira, has been traveling the Earth Kingdom with Bolin, Varrick, and her  fianc√©e, Baatar Jr., on a quest to reunite the nation after it fell into  disarray following Queen Hou-Ting's death. When she was supposed to relinquish  control to the newly crowned Earth King Wu, she denounced his authority and  appointed herself the ruler of the Earth Empire. Meanwhile, Korra managed to  heal physically, though she is still facing an emotional block caused by  residual traces of mercury. With troubles coming to the Earth Kingdom, Team  Avatar divided, and the Avatar's whereabouts unknown, the search for balance  begins anew.</p></td>
